## Factorio Waypoint (WIP)

Simple addon (mod), which allows storing and operate with waypoints

At this moment mod only shows cursor position, player position and distance between them on SHIFT+R. IDK if I would continue working on this, since this is just a trying to investigate a bit Factorio API and practice with Lua. At least, I have several ideas what can be done. Main thing for me right now - show me where I should find my car xD
So, I should store Position when leave the vehicle and then show direction and optionally calculate distance and needed time.
Also, I would like to store sort of POI and maybe compare distances between several ways.
